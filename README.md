### Project Overview
-------
This project aims to collect and analyze data from various regions, stores, and markets to provide actionable insights that will inform business strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction, gaining insights into revenue, units sold, and transaction categories across various regions and stores is critical for driving business strategies and improving overall performance. This project systematically collects and analyzes relevant data to provide actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, and market dynamics over different periods.

### Project Objectives
---------------
This project objective was outlined to achieve the following analysis goals:
 - Data Collection: Collect detailed data on revenue, units sold, and transaction categories from various stores and regions.
 - Trend Analysis: Analyze historical data to identify trends and patterns in revenue generation, unit sales, and transaction types over specified periods.
 - Performance Metrics: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor sales performance and growth in product categories.
 - Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports that summarize findings and provide strategic recommendations based on the analysis.

### Data Sources
------
The data sources include the following keys:
1. Region: This represents the geographical areas where stores are situated. 
2. Market: These refer to specific segments within a broader region that capture various demographics and economic conditions. 
3. Store: These refer to individual retail locations or outlets.
4. Trade Date: This indicates the date transactions occurred.
5. Fiscal Period: This represents the timeframes used for financial reporting (e.g., quarters, months) to evaluate performance against budget and forecasts.
6. Model: This refers to the specific type or brand of a product offered for sale. 
7. Line of Business: This represents the different sectors or categories under which products or services are offered. 
8. Day: This represents the specific days of the week transactions occur. 
9. Category: This classifies products based on shared characteristics or functions.
10. Revenue: refers to the total income generated from sales transactions.
11. Units Sold: This indicates the quantity of products sold during a specific period.
12. Transaction Category: This classifies sales transactions into various types (e.g., online, in-store, returns) to analyze customer behavior and sales channel performance.

These datasets collectively provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and market dynamics, enabling informed decision-making.

### Metrics of Focus:
-------
- Revenue: Total sales revenue generated from different regions and stores.
- Units Sold: Number of units sold across various transaction categories.
- Transaction Categories: Categorization of transactions to understand customer purchasing behavior.

### Tools Used
-------
 - Microsoft Excel: 
    - Pivot Tables: Summarizing data and generating insights based on revenue, units sold, and transaction categories.
    - Formulas and Functions: Calculate performance metrics and automate processes like sorting and filtering.
    - Data Visualizations (Charts, Graphs): To create visual representations of trends, comparisons, and key insights. 

### Exploratory Data Analysis
--------
EDA involves exploring the data to answer some questions about the data such as;

- What is the overall revenue for each region?
- What are the models for peak sales?
- Which store has the lowest unit?

### Deduction:
  1. #### General Revenue Trajectory:
      This graph shows a steady decline in revenue across regions. The trajectory highlights a clear disparity in regional revenue generation, with significant opportunities for improvement in the lower-performing areas like North Central and North West.
  2. #### Regional Performance:
 - North East: The chart shows that the North East region generates the highest revenue, significantly outperforming other region. This suggests a strong market presence, high customer demand, or effective business operations in this area.
 - South West: The second-highest revenue generator. It shows solid performance, though not as strong as North East, indicating a relatively healthy market.
 - South-South: This region still contributes significantly but could offer potential for further growth. It reflects the start of a downward trend in revenue across regions.
 - South-East: indicating a decline compared to the top-performing regions. The region may have untapped market potential or need targeted strategies to boost performance.
 - North-West: This shows a considerable drop from the other regions. It represents an underperforming area that could benefit from increased focus and investment.
 - North-Central: This region appears to have the weakest market presence, making it a prime candidate for strategic improvements and market development.
   
 3. ##### Revenue Allocation:
     The significant difference in revenue across regions suggests that resources, such as marketing, sales, or operational efforts, might be unevenly distributed. The company could focus on optimizing resources 
    in South East, North West, and North Central to drive revenue growth.

#### Conclusion
  The Revenue data suggests that the organization experiences its strongest performance in the North-East, with diminishing results as it moves to the South-West, South-South, South East, North West, and finally, North Central. The trajectory highlights a clear disparity in regional revenue generation, with significant opportunities for improvement in lower-performing regions like North Central and North West.  It highlights geographical disparities in revenue generation, possibly due to market size, customer demand, or regional business strategies.
