This project objective was outlined to achieve the following analysis goals:
 - Data Collection: Collect detailed data on revenue, units sold, and transaction categories from various stores and regions.
 - Trend Analysis: Analyze historical data to identify trends and patterns in revenue generation, unit sales, and transaction types over specified periods.
 - Performance Metrics: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor sales performance and growth in product categories.
 - Reporting: Generate comprehensive reports that summarize findings and provide strategic recommendations based on the analysis.

### Data Sources

The data sources include the following keys:
1. Region: This represents the geographical areas where stores are situated. 
2. Market: These refer to specific segments within a broader region that capture various demographics and economic conditions. 
3. Store: These refer to individual retail locations or outlets.
4. Trade Date: This indicates the date transactions occurred.
5. Fiscal Period: This represents the timeframes used for financial reporting (e.g., quarters, months) to evaluate performance against budget and forecasts.
6. Model: This refers to the specific type or brand of a product offered for sale. 
7. Line of Business: This represents the different sectors or categories under which products or services are offered.
