### Project Overview
-------
This project aims to collect and analyze data from various regions, stores, and markets to provide actionable insights that will inform business strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction, gaining insights into revenue, units sold, and transaction categories across various regions and stores is critical for driving business strategies and improving overall performance. This project systematically collects and analyzes relevant data to provide actionable insights into sales trends, product performance, and market dynamics over different periods.

### Data Sources
------
The data sources include the following keys:
1. Region: This represents the geographical areas where stores are situated. 
2. Market: These refer to specific segments within a broader region that capture various demographics and economic conditions. 
3. Store: These refer to individual retail locations or outlets. This dataset captures information about store performance, inventory, and sales metrics.
4. Trade Date: This indicates the date on which transactions occurred, crucial for time-based analysis such as daily sales trends and seasonal performance.
5. Fiscal Period: This represents the timeframes used for financial reporting (e.g., quarters, months) to evaluate performance against budget and forecasts.
6. Model: This refers to the specific type or brand of a product offered for sale. 
7. Line of Business: This represents the different sectors or categories under which products or services are offered. 
8. Day: This represents the specific days of the week in which transactions occur. This dataset is useful for analyzing daily sales patterns and peak shopping times.
9. Category: This classifies products into different groups based on shared characteristics or functions, facilitating targeted marketing and inventory management.
10. Revenue: This refers to the total income generated from sales transactions, providing insights into financial performance and growth trends.
11. Units Sold: This indicates the quantity of products sold during a specific period, essential for inventory management and assessing sales effectiveness.
12. Transaction Category: This classifies sales transactions into various types (e.g., online, in-store, returns) to analyze customer behavior and sales channel performance.

These datasets collectively provide a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and market dynamics, enabling informed decision-making.

### Project Objectives

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
-----
In the initial Phase of the data cleaning and preparation, we performed the following actions; 

- Data Loading and Inspection
- Handling missing variables
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
--------
EDA involves exploring the data to answer some questions about the data such as;

- What is the overall revenue for each region?
- What are the models for peak sales?
- Which store has the lowest unit?

### Data Analysis
------
Here we included some basic lines of code and functions used during our analysis;

- Basic Excel Functions
